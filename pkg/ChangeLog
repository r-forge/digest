2013-01-21  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): Version 0.6.1

	* inst/GPL-2: Added as a fixed reference input for regression tests
	via the scripts in tests/ as the versions installed by R differ
	across OS and installations

	* tests/digestTest.R: No longer rely on file.path(R.home(),"COPYING")
	but rather use our own copy of GPL-2; ensure final test does not print
	* tests/digestTest.Rout.save: Updated accordingly

2013-01-19  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* DESCRIPTION (Authors): Added Duncan Murdoch

2013-01-19  Duncan Murdoch <murdoch.duncan@gmail.com>

2012-11-25  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* Release 0.6.0

	* src/sha2.h: In order to build on Windows:
	  - Include the newer header file stdint.h
	  - Enforce standard integer types by defining SHA2_USE_INTTYPES_H
	  - Define BYTE_ORDER and default to LITTLE_ENDIAN

	* src/digest.c: Use uint8_t from stdint.h for sha256

2012-11-24  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* src/digest.c: Allow for extra null character in output[] vector

	* tests/digestTest.Rout.save: Update/Revert a change by Hannes;
	Naturally we do not get a single set that works for R-release and
	R-devel. Sigh.

2012-11-24  Hannes MÃ¼hleisen  <hannes@cwi.nl>

	* src/digest.c: sha-512 integration
	* src/sha2.h: Header file for Aaron Gifford's SHA2 implementation
	* src/sha2.c: Aaron Gifford's sha2 implementation

	* R/hmac.R: enabled new sha-512 algorithm parameter
	* man/digest.Rd: documented new sha-512 algorithm parameter
	* man/hmac.Rd: documented new sha-512 algorithm parameter
	* tests/digestTest.R: Added sha-512 test cases

2012-03-14  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* Release 0.5.2

	* Applied patch by Murray Stokely:
	  - R/digest.R: Additional test for file accessibility; segfault can
	    happen if inaccesible file passed down
	  - tests/digestTest.R: New test which leads to segfault in unpatched
   	    package, and passes with these changes
	  - src/digest.c: Simpler use of error() via format string

	* DESCRIPTION: Fixed one typo in extended description

	* tests/digest.Rout.save: Updated to current output; version 0.5.1
	created the same difference so it is presumably once again something
	that changed in R's serialization. Oh, and R-devel changes it again.

	  across R versions, adds an ascii flag, adds skip="auto" support
	  to by pass the version header info, and clean the file option
	  interface. This effectively replaces Henrik's patch relative to
	  the 0.2.3 release.  Thanks for the patches, Simon!
