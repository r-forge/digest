	- R/digest.R, man/digest.Rd, Applied two more patches by
	  Simon Urbanek that clean object mangling (for better comparison
	  across R versions, adds an ascii flag, adds skip="auto" support
	  to by pass the version header info, and clean the file option
	  interface. This effectively replaces Henrik's patch relative to
	  the 0.2.3 release.  Thanks for the patches, Simon!

	  support for 'raw' serialization input
